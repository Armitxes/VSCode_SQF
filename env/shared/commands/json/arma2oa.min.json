The limit may or may not change in the future and is currently 10240 bytes. It is up to extension designer to handle multipart results if returned data exceeds output limit. brbr Since Arma 3 v1.67 it is possible to pass array of arguments to extensions. The array of arguments could be anything and all elements will be converted to strings, however you might want to only send simple types like Server Options). brbr If an extension with the given name can't be found (or it is found but doesn't implement the required interface properly / at all) the following error will be written into the RPT (In this example the given dll-name was \"MyExtension\"): code14:27:07 CallExtension 'MyExtension' could not be found</code> br If an extension is not whitelisted with BattlEye (see \"ExtensionCallback\" mission event handler with 3 user supplied params. The params are * hlname - make it unique name, for example the extension name, so that other modders can quickly filter out calls from own extensions * hlfunction - make it name of the function the extension sends the result to. (Note: The returned function is just a STRING! So compile is needed, before using call or spawn, to execute it) * hldata - make it the actual result. You can also format it as an array so it could be parsed by parseSimpleArray Calling function pointer returns an hlint. This is the number of available slots in the input buffer left for this frame after your call and can range from 99 to -1. The buffer is processed and cleared every frame and the maximum number of slots that can be filled per frame is 100. If you are planning to call back with more than 100 results per frame, make sure your extension retries if it receives negative hlint, which means the buffer was full and your call did not succeed. Ideally suited for callbacks from different threads, but if callback is initiated from the calling thread, the EH will fire on the next frame of game simulation. Needless to say, the \"ExtensionCallback\" event handler needs to exist before any callbacks, otherwise the data will just stay in the buffer. Removing all \"ExtensionCallback\" EHs clears the buffer as well as mission restart.","example":"_return = \"myExtension\" callExtension \"stringToBeParsed\";","params":"<string> <string> <string> <string> <array>","returns":"string","command":"callExtension","version":"1.60"},"entities":{"timestamp":"2021-01-23T00:59:03Z","syntax":"entities <string>","docSyntax":"entities type","tags":"","description":"Returns a list of all alive and dead entities of the given type or deriving from the given type.
