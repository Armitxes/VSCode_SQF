The FSM file is first searched in the mission folder, then in the campaign scripts folder and finally in the global scripts folder. Argument (if any) are available in hl_this variable inside FSM. Variables set inside FSMs can be read/modified externally, using setFSMVariable and getFSMVariable commands.br br The return value is the FSM handle; it can be used to determine (via completedFSM) when the FSM has finished. Featurearma3In Arma 3, the FSM handle is also available within the FSM through the hl_thisFSM variable. br Scripted FSMs are added into the scheduler just like exec scripts, execVM scripts and spawn scripts.br To see what FSMs are currently in the scheduler, use diag_activeMissionFSMs command. FeatureimportantWhile the code placed into any of the sections of FSM cannot be suspended (canSuspend is false), the FSM itself is suspended every simulation between the state's hlinit and hlprecondition (exception is the 'init state'). This is the only place where scripted FSM is suspended/resumed. The usual difference between the state's hlinit and hlprecondition is 1 frame but if the scheduler is busy it can take longer.
